# Tags - An Exercise for Practicing Project Collaboration in git

*Goal*: Your team will become comfortable collaborating with git by making changes to this code base and delivering them on `master`, eventually culminating in an app like the one on the `sample-solution` branch. 

*Objective*: Using git, you and your team will collaborate to deliver changes that improve a code base.

Two tracks are offered, according to your team's preference (the [Curriculum Introduction](https://walquis.github.io/tags) will go into more detail):

MILD: Your team will make changes to static HTML files.  The only "webserver" is your filesystem.

SPICY: The Django "tags" webapp will list tags and store more tags, using a SQLite database.  It will also display an image, woohoo.  However, right now this app doesn't even say "Hello, World!".  It needs you.

As your team begins to deliver completed tasks, you will run into challenges (merge conflicts!) associated with working in parallel on a code base, and you will practice using git to solve them.

The `master` branch starts at a working version of static webpage (MILD) or an empty app (SPICY).  To provide some ideas for changes, branches are provided as references to possible tasks your team could undertake.  For instance, each commit on the `sample-solution` branch is also a working version.  The goal here is not so much to learn new programming language concepts, but to learn new git-based code collaboration skills .

Keep the page (or app) working as you deliver each change to `master`. &nbsp;&nbsp;Don't "break the build"!
